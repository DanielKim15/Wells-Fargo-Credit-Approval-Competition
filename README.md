# Wells-Fargo-Credit-Approval-Competition
For years banks have reliably used statistical modeling to predict whether to approve or disapprove credit to individuals. Banks have to carefully choose which person to give credit since they have a finite amount in their system, so accuracy is very important in prediction. Always looking for another method to improve their prediction ability, they started looking toward machine learning models as an alternative tool to use. To test their effectiveness, I decided to build a logistic regression, a statistical model, and a random forest, machine learning model, and compared side by side the results of their predictive power.

Goal: Figure out which predictors (past delinquency, average credit debt, etc) affected the account holder the most when it comes to getting a default or not.
